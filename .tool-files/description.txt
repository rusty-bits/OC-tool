SSDT-AWAC.aml
This is the 300 series RTC patch, needed for certain Z390 systems.
SSDT-RTC0.aml
Alternative to SSDT-AWAC when not compatible with your system.
SSDT-EC-USBX.aml
Needed to setup USB power and such correctly, prefered option over renaming XHCI. This SSDT is meant for Skylake+ systems, please use SSDT-EC and SSDT-EHCx_OFF for older systems.
SSDT-EC.aml
Needed to setup USB power correctly on pre-skylake systems.
SSDT-EHCx_OFF.aml
Prefered alternative over renaming EHCI for setting up USB correctly on pre-skylake systems.
SSDT-PLUG.aml
Sets PluginType, Clover altrenative would be under Acpi -> GenerateOptions -> PluginType. Do note that this SSDT is made for systems where AppleACPICPU attaches CPU0, though some systems have theirs starting at PR00 so adjust accordingly.
SSDT-SBUS-MCHC.aml
Adds a SMbus device and fixes DeviceProperties injection via _DSM which is found in your DSDT table. Most can ignore.
FadtEnableReset
Provide reset register and flag in FADT table to enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware. Not recommended unless required.
NormalizeHeaders
Cleanup ACPI header fields to workaround macOS ACPI implementation bug causing boot crashes. Reference: Debugging AppleACPIPlatform on 10.13 by Alex James aka theracermaster. The issue is fixed in macOS Mojave (10.14).
RebaseRegions
Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions. Not recommended. ACPI tables are often generated dynamically by underlying firmware implementation. Among the positionindependent code, ACPI tables may contain physical addresses of MMIO areas used for device configuration, usually grouped in regions (e.g. OperationRegion). Changing firmware settings or hardware configuration, upgrading or patching the firmware inevitably leads to changes in dynamically generated ACPI code, which sometimes lead to the shift of the addresses in aforementioned OperationRegion constructions. For this reason it is very dangerous to apply any kind of modifications to ACPI tables. The most reasonable approach is to make as few as possible changes to ACPI and try to not replace any tables, especially DSDT. When this is not possible, then at least attempt to ensure that custom DSDT is based on the most recent DSDT or remove writes and reads for the affected areas. When nothing else helps this option could be tried to avoid stalls at PCI Configuration Begin phase of macOS booting by attempting to fix the ACPI addresses. It does not do magic, and only works with most common cases. Do not use unless absolutely required.
ResetHwSig
Reset FACS table HardwareSignature value to 0. This works around firmwares that fail to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation.
ResetLogoStatus
Reset BGRT table Displayed status field to false. This works around firmwares that provide BGRT table but fail to handle screen updates afterwards.
MmioWhitelist
Designed to be filled with plist dict values, describing addresses critical for particular firmware functioning when DevirtualiseMmio quirk is in use. See MmioWhitelist Properties section below.
Quirks
Apply individual booter quirks described in Quirks Properties section below.
AvoidRuntimeDefrag
Protect from boot.efi runtime memory defragmentation. This option fixes UEFI runtime services (date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc.) support on many firmwares using SMM backing for select services like variable storage. SMM may try to access physical addresses, but they get moved by boot.efi. Note : Most but Apple and VMware firmwares need this quirk.
DevirtualiseMmio
Remove runtime attribute from select MMIO regions. This option reduces stolen memory footprint from the memory map by removing runtime bit for known memory regions. This quirk may result in the increase of KASLR slides available, but is not necessarily compatible with the target board without additional measures. In general this frees from 64 to 256 megabytes of memory (present in the debug log), and on some platforms it is the only way to boot macOS, which otherwise fails with allocation error at bootloader stage. This option is generally useful on all firmwares except some very old ones, like Sandy Bridge. On select firmwares it may require a list of exceptional addresses that still need to get their virtual addresses for proper NVRAM and hibernation functioning. Use MmioWhitelist section to do this.
DisableSingleUser
Disable single user mode. This is a security option allowing one to restrict single user mode usage by ignoring CMD+S hotkey and -s boot argument. The behaviour with this quirk enabled is supposed to match T2-based model behaviour. Read this article to understand how to use single user mode with this quirk enabled.
DisableVariableWrite
Protect from macOS NVRAM write access. This is a security option allowing one to restrict NVRAM access in macOS. This quirk requires OC_FIRMWARE_RUNTIME protocol implemented in FwRuntimeServices.efi. Note : This quirk can also be used as an ugly workaround to buggy UEFI runtime services implementations that fail to write variables to NVRAM and break the rest of the operating system.
DiscardHibernateMap
Reuse original hibernate memory map. This option forces XNU kernel to ignore newly supplied memory map and assume that it did not change after waking from hibernation. This behaviour is required to work by Windows, which mandates to preserve runtime memory size and location after S4 wake. Note : This may be used to workaround buggy memory maps on older hardware, and is now considered rare legacy. Examples of such hardware are Ivy Bridge laptops with Insyde firmware, like Acer V3-571G. Do not use this unless you fully understand the consequences.
EnableSafeModeSlide
Patch bootloader to have KASLR enabled in safe mode. This option is relevant to the users that have issues booting to safe mode (e.g. by holding shift or using -x boot argument). By default safe mode forces 0 slide as if the system was launched with slide=0 boot argument. This quirk tries to patch boot.efi to lift that limitation and let some other value (from 1 to 255) be used. This quirk requires ProvideCustomSlide to be enabled. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by safe mode availability. If booting to safe mode fails, this option can be tried to be enabled.
EnableWriteUnprotector
Permit write access to UEFI runtime services code. This option bypasses R^ X permissions in code pages of UEFI runtime services by removing write protection (WP) bit from CR0 register during their execution. This quirk requires OC_FIRMWARE_RUNTIME protocol implemented in FwRuntimeServices.efi. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by early boot crashes of the firmware.
ForceExitBootServices
Retry ExitBootServices with new memory map on failure. Try to ensure that ExitBootServices call succeeds even with outdated MemoryMap key argument by obtaining current memory map and retrying ExitBootServices call. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by early boot crashes of the firmware. Do not use this unless you fully understand the consequences.
ProtectCsmRegion
Protect CSM region areas from relocation. Ensure that CSM memory regions are marked as ACPI NVS to prevent boot.efi or XNU from relocating or using them. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by artifacts and sleep wake issues. As AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves a similar problem, no known firmwares should need this quirk. Do not use this unless you fully understand the consequences.
ProtectSecureBoot
Protect UEFI Secure Boot variables from being written. Reports security violation during attempts to write to db, dbx, PK, and KEK variables from the operating system. Note : This quirk mainly attempts to avoid issues with NVRAM implementations with problematic defragmentation, such as select Insyde or MacPro5,1.
ProvideCustomSlide
Provide custom KASLR slide on low memory. This option performs memory map analysis of your firmware and checks whether all slides (from 1 to 255) can be used. As boot.efi generates this value randomly with rdrand or pseudo randomly rdtsc, there is a chance of boot failure when it chooses a conflicting slide. In case potential conflicts exist, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo random value among the available ones. This also ensures that slide= argument is never passed to the operating system for security reasons. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by OCABC: Only N/256 slide values are usable! message in the debug log. If the message is present, this option is to be enabled.
SetupVirtualMap
Setup virtual memory at SetVirtualAddresses. Select firmwares access memory by virtual addresses after SetVirtualAddresses call, which results in early boot crashes. This quirk workarounds the problem by performing early boot identity mapping of assigned virtual addresses to physical memory. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by early boot failures. Currently new firmwares with memory protection support (like OVMF) do not support this quirk due to acidanthera/bugtracker#719.
ShrinkMemoryMap
Attempt to join similar memory map entries. Select firmwares have very large memory maps, which do not fit Apple kernel, permitting up to 64 slots for runtime memory. This quirk attempts to unify contiguous slots of similar types to prevent boot failures. Note : The necessity of this quirk is determined by early boot failures. It is rare to need this quirk on Haswell or newer. Do not use unless you fully understand the consequences.
SignalAppleOS
Report macOS being loaded through OS Info for any OS. This quirk is useful on Mac firmwares, which behave differently in different OS. For example, it is supposed to enable Intel GPU in Windows and Linux in some dual-GPU MacBook models.
BundlePath
Kext bundle path (e.g. Lilu.kext or MyKext.kext/Contents/PlugIns/MySubKext.kext).
Comment
Arbitrary ASCII string used to provide human readable reference for the entry. It is implementation defined whether this value is used.
Enabled
This kernel driver will not be added unless set to true.
ExecutablePath
Kext executable path relative to bundle (e.g. Contents/MacOS/Lilu).
MaxKernel
Adds kernel driver on specified macOS version or older. Kernel version can be obtained with uname -r command, and should look like 3 numbers separated by dots, for example 18.7.0 is the kernel version for 10.14.6. Kernel version interpretation is implemented as follows: P arseDarwinV ersion(, , µ) =  · 10000 Where   (0, 99) is kernel version major +  · 100 +µ Kernel version comparison is implemented as follows: = P arseDarwinV ersion(MinKernel), 0 P arseDarwinV ersion(MaxKernel),  P arseDarwinV ersion(F indDarwinV ersion()),  f (, ,  ) =      Here P arseDarwinV ersion argument is assumed to be 3 integers obtained by splitting Darwin kernel version string from left to right by the . symbol. F indDarwinV ersion function looks up Darwin kernel version by locating "Darwin Kernel Version ..µ" string in the kernel image.
MinKernel
Adds kernel driver on specified macOS version or newer. Note : Refer to Add MaxKernel description for matching logic.
PlistPath
Kext Info.plist path relative to bundle (e.g. Contents/Info.plist). If MinKernel is valid Otherwise If MaxKernel is valid Otherwise If valid "Darwin Kernel Version" is found Otherwise Where   (0, 99) is kernel version minor Where µ  (0, 99) is kernel version patch
Cpuid1Data
Sequence of EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX values to replace CPUID (1) call in XNU kernel. This property serves for two needs: · Enabling support of an unsupported CPU model. · Enabling XCPM support for an unsupported CPU variant. Normally it is only the value of EAX that needs to be taken care of, since it represents the full CPUID. The remaining bytes are to be left as zeroes. Byte order is Little Endian, so for example, A9 06 03 00 stands for CPUID 0x0306A9 (Ivy Bridge). For XCPM support it is recommended to use the following combinations. · Haswell-E (0x306F2) to Haswell (0x0306C3): Cpuid1Data: C3 06 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Cpuid1Mask: FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 · Broadwell-E (0x0406F1) to Broadwell (0x0306D4): Cpuid1Data: D4 06 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Cpuid1Mask: FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Cpuid1Mask
Bit mask of active bits in Cpuid1Data. When each Cpuid1Mask bit is set to 0, the original CPU bit is used, otherwise set bits take the value of Cpuid1Data. 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Further explanations can be found at acidanthera/bugtracker#365. See Special NOTES for Haswell+ low-end.
AppleCpuPmCfgLock
Disables PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL (0xE2) MSR modification in AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext, commonly causing early kernel panic, when it is locked from writing. Certain firmwares lock PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL MSR register. To check its state one can use bundled VerifyMsrE2 tool. Select firmwares have this register locked on some cores only. As modern firmwares provide CFG Lock setting, which allows configuring PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL MSR register lock, this option should be avoided whenever possible. For several APTIO firmwares not displaying CFG Lock setting in the GUI it is possible to access the option directly: (a) Download UEFITool and IFR-Extractor. (b) Open your firmware image in UEFITool and find CFG Lock unicode string. If it is not present, your firmware may not have this option and you should stop. (c) Extract the Setup.bin PE32 Image Section (the one UEFITool found) through Extract Body menu option. (d) Run IFR-Extractor on the extracted file (e.g. ./ifrextract Setup.bin Setup.txt). (e) Find CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): in Setup.txt and remember the offset right after it (e.g. 0x123). (f) Download and run Modified GRUB Shell compiled by brainsucker or use a newer version by datasone. (g) Enter setup_var 0x123 0x00 command, where 0x123 should be replaced by your actual offset, and reboot. WARNING: Variable offsets are unique not only to each motherboard but even to its firmware version. Never ever try to use an offset without checking.
AppleXcpmCfgLock
Disables PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL (0xE2) MSR modification in XNU kernel, commonly causing early kernel panic, when it is locked from writing (XCPM power management). Note : This option should be avoided whenever possible. See AppleCpuPmCfgLock description for more details.
AppleXcpmExtraMsrs
Disables multiple MSR access critical for select CPUs, which have no native XCPM support. This is normally used in conjunction with Emulate section on Haswell-E, Broadwell-E, Skylake-X, and similar CPUs. More details on the XCPM patches are outlined in acidanthera/bugtracker#365. Note : Additional not provided patches will be required for Ivy Bridge or Pentium CPUs. It is recommended to use AppleIntelCpuPowerManagement.kext for the former.
AppleXcpmForceBoost
Forces maximum performance in XCPM mode. This patch writes 0xFF00 to MSR_IA32_PERF_CONTROL (0x199), effectively setting maximum multiplier for all the time. Note : While this may increase the performance, this patch is strongly discouraged on all systems but those explicitly dedicated to scientific or media calculations. In general only certain Xeon models benefit from the patch.
CustomSMBIOSGuid
Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops.
DisableIoMapper
Disables IOMapper support in XNU (VT-d), which may conflict with the firmware implementation. Note : This option is a preferred alternative to dropping DMAR ACPI table and disabling VT-d in firmware preferences, which does not break VT-d support in other systems in case they need it.
DummyPowerManagement
Disables AppleIntelCpuPowerManagement. Note : This option is a preferred alternative to NullCpuPowerManagement.kext for CPUs without native power management driver in macOS.
ExternalDiskIcons
Apply icon type patches to AppleAHCIPort.kext to force internal disk icons for all AHCI disks. Note : This option should be avoided whenever possible. Modern firmwares usually have compatible AHCI controllers.
IncreasePciBarSize
Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GBs. Note : This option should be avoided whenever possible. In general the necessity of this option means misconfigured or broken firmware.
LapicKernelPanic
Disables kernel panic on LAPIC interrupts.
PanicNoKextDump
Prevent kernel from printing kext dump in the panic log preventing from observing panic details. Affects 10.13 and above.
PowerTimeoutKernelPanic
Disables kernel panic on setPowerState timeout. An additional security measure was added to macOS Catalina (10.15) causing kernel panic on power change timeout for Apple drivers. Sometimes it may cause issues on misconfigured hardware, notably digital audio, which sometimes fails to wake up. For debug kernels setpowerstate_panic=0 boot argument should be used, which is otherwise equivalent to this quirk.
ThirdPartyDrives
Apply vendor patches to IOAHCIBlockStorage.kext to enable native features for third-party drives, such as TRIM on SSDs or hibernation support on 10.15 and newer. Note : This option may be avoided on user preference. NVMe SSDs are compatible without the change. For AHCI SSDs on modern macOS version there is a dedicated built-in utility called trimforce. Starting from 10.15 this utility creates EnableTRIM variable in APPLE_BOOT_VARIABLE_GUID namespace with 01 00 00 00 value.
XhciPortLimit
Patch various kexts (AppleUSBXHCI.kext, AppleUSBXHCIPCI.kext, IOUSBHostFamily.kext) to remove USB port count limit of 15 ports. Note : This option should be avoided whenever possible. USB port limit is imposed by the amount of used bits in locationID format and there is no possible way to workaround this without heavy OS modification. The only valid solution is to limit the amount of used ports to 15 (discarding some). More details can be found on AppleLife.ru.
HibernateMode
Hibernation detection mode. The following modes are supported: · · · · None -- Avoid hibernation for your own good. Auto -- Use RTC and NVRAM detection. RTC -- Use RTC detection. NVRAM -- Use NVRAM detection.
HideAuxiliary
Hides auxiliary entries from picker menu by default. An entry is considered auxiliary when at least one of the following applies: · Entry is macOS recovery. · Entry is explicitly marked as Auxiliary. · Entry is system (e.g. Clean NVRAM). To see all entries picker menu needs to be reloaded in extended mode by pressing Spacebar key. Hiding auxiliary entries may increase boot performance for multidisk systems.
HideSelf
Hides own boot entry from boot picker. This may potentially hide other entries, for instance, when another UEFI OS is installed on the same volume and driver boot is used.
PickerAttributes
Sets specific attributes for picker. Builtin picker supports colour arguments as a sum of foreground and background colors according to UEFI specification. The value of black background and black foreground (0) is reserved. List of colour names: · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0A 0x0B 0x0C 0x0D 0x0E 0x0F 0x00 0x10 0x20 0x30 0x40 0x50 0x60 0x70 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- EFI_BLACK EFI_BLUE EFI_GREEN EFI_CYAN EFI_RED EFI_MAGENTA EFI_BROWN EFI_LIGHTGRAY EFI_DARKGRAY EFI_LIGHTBLUE EFI_LIGHTGREEN EFI_LIGHTCYAN EFI_LIGHTRED EFI_LIGHTMAGENTA EFI_YELLOW EFI_WHITE EFI_BACKGROUND_BLACK EFI_BACKGROUND_BLUE EFI_BACKGROUND_GREEN EFI_BACKGROUND_CYAN EFI_BACKGROUND_RED EFI_BACKGROUND_MAGENTA EFI_BACKGROUND_BROWN EFI_BACKGROUND_LIGHTGRAY Note : This option may not work well with System text renderer. Setting a background different from black could help testing proper GOP functioning.
PollAppleHotKeys
Enable modifier hotkey handling in boot picker. In addition to action hotkeys, which are partially described in PickerMode section and are normally handled by Apple BDS, there exist modifier keys, which are handled by operating system bootloader, namely boot.efi. These keys allow to change operating system behaviour by providing different boot modes. On some firmwares it may be problematic to use modifier keys due to driver incompatibilities. To workaround this problem this option allows registering select hotkeys in a more permissive manner from within boot picker. Such extensions include the support of tapping on keys in addition to holding and pressing Shift along with other keys instead of just Shift alone, which is not detectible on many PS/2 keyboards. This list of known modifier hotkeys includes: · · · · · · CMD+C+MINUS -- disable board compatibility checking. CMD+K -- boot release kernel, similar to kcsuffix=release. CMD+S -- single user mode. CMD+S+MINUS -- disable KASLR slide, requires disabled SIP. CMD+V -- verbose mode. Shift -- safe mode.
ShowPicker
Show simple boot picker to allow boot entry selection.
TakeoffDelay
Delay in microseconds performed before handling picker startup and action hotkeys. Introducing a delay may give extra time to hold the right action hotkey sequence to e.g. boot to recovery mode. On some platforms setting this option to at least 5000-10000 microseconds may be necessary to access action hotkeys at all due to the nature of the keyboard driver.
Timeout
Timeout in seconds in boot picker before automatic booting of the default boot entry. Use 0 to disable timer.
PickerMode
Choose boot picker used for boot management. Picker describes underlying boot management with an optional user interface responsible for handling boot options. The following values are supported: · Builtin -- boot management is handled by OpenCore, a simple text only user interface is used. · External -- an external boot management protocol is used if available. Otherwise Builtin mode is used. · Apple -- Apple boot management is used if available. Otherwise Builtin mode is used. Upon success External mode will entirely disable all boot management in OpenCore except policy enforcement. In Apple mode it may additionally bypass policy enforcement. To implement External mode a custom user interface may utilise OcSupportPkg OcBootManagementLib. Reference example of external graphics interface is provided in ExternalUi test driver. OpenCore built-in boot picker contains a set of actions chosen during the boot process. The list of supported actions is similar to Apple BDS and in general can be accessed by holding action hotkeys during boot process. Currently the following actions are considered: · Default -- this is the default option, and it lets OpenCore built-in boot picker to loads the default boot option as specified in Startup Disk preference pane. · ShowPicker -- this option forces picker to show. Normally it can be achieved by holding OPT key during boot. Setting ShowPicker to true will make ShowPicker the default option. · ResetNvram -- this option performs select UEFI variable erase and is normally achieved by holding CMD+OPT+P+R key combination during boot. Another way to erase UEFI variables is to choose Reset NVRAM in the picker. This option requires AllowNvramReset to be set to true. · BootApple -- this options performs booting to the first found Apple operating system unless the default chosen operating system is already made by Apple. Hold X key to choose this option. · BootAppleRecovery -- this option performs booting to Apple operating system recovery. Either the one related to the default chosen operating system, or first found in case default chosen operating system is not made by Apple or has no recovery. Hold CMD+R key combination to choose this option. Note 1 : Activated KeySupport, AppleUsbKbDxe, or similar driver is required for key handling to work. On many firmwares it is not possible to get all the keys function. Note 2 : In addition to OPT OpenCore supports Escape key to display picker when ShowPicker is disabled. This key exists for Apple picker mode and for firmwares with PS/2 keyboards that fail to report held OPT key and require continual presses of Escape key to enter the boot menu. Note 3 : On Macs with problematic GOP it may be difficult to access Apple BootPicker. To workaround this problem even without loading OpenCore BootKicker utility can be blessed.
DisableWatchDog
Select firmwares may not succeed in quickly booting the operating system, especially in debug mode, which results in watch dog timer aborting the process. This option turns off watch dog timer.
DisplayDelay
Delay in microseconds performed after every printed line visible onscreen (i.e. console).
DisplayLevel
EDK II debug level bitmask (sum) showed onscreen. Unless Target enables console (onscreen) printing, onscreen debug output will not be visible. The following levels are supported (discover more in DebugLib.h): · · · · 0x00000002 0x00000040 0x00400000 0x80000000 (bit (bit (bit (bit 1) -- DEBUG_WARN in DEBUG, NOOPT, RELEASE. 6) -- DEBUG_INFO in DEBUG, NOOPT. 22) -- DEBUG_VERBOSE in custom builds. 31) -- DEBUG_ERROR in DEBUG, NOOPT, RELEASE.
Target
A bitmask (sum) of enabled logging targets. By default all the logging output is hidden, so this option is required to be set when debugging is necessary. The following logging targets are supported: · · · · · · · 0x01 0x02 0x04 0x08 0x10 0x20 0x40 (bit (bit (bit (bit (bit (bit (bit 0) 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Enable Enable Enable Enable Enable Enable Enable logging, otherwise all log is discarded. basic console (onscreen) logging. logging to Data Hub. serial port logging. UEFI variable logging. non-volatile UEFI variable logging. logging to file. Console logging prints less than all the other variants. Depending on the build type (RELEASE, DEBUG, or NOOPT) different amount of logging may be read (from least to most). Data Hub log will not log kernel and kext patches. To obtain Data Hub log use the following command in macOS: ioreg -lw0 -p IODeviceTree | grep boot-log | sort | sed s/.*<\(.*\)>.*/\1/ | xxd -r -p UEFI variable log does not include some messages and has no performance data. For safety reasons log size is limited to 32 kilobytes. Some firmwares may truncate it much earlier or drop completely if they have no memory. Using non-volatile flag will write the log to NVRAM flash after every printed line. To obtain UEFI variable log use the following command in macOS: nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:boot-log | awk {gsub(/%0d%0a%00/,"");gsub(/%0d%0a/,"\n")}1 Warning : Some firmwares are reported to have broken NVRAM garbage collection. This means that they may not be able to always free space after variable deletion. Do not use non-volatile NVRAM logging without extra need on such devices. While OpenCore boot log already contains basic version information with build type and date, this data may also be found in NVRAM in opencore-version variable even with boot log disabled. File logging will create a file named opencore-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.txt at EFI volume root with log contents (the upper case letter sequence is replaced with date and time from the firmware). Please be warned that some file system drivers present in firmwares are not reliable, and may corrupt data when writing files through UEFI. Log is attempted to be written in the safest manner, and thus is very slow. Ensure that DisableWatchDog is set to true when you use a slow drive.
AllowNvramReset
Allow CMD+OPT+P+R handling and enable showing NVRAM Reset entry in boot picker.
AllowSetDefault
Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index handling to set the default boot option in boot picker.
AuthRestart
Enable VirtualSMC-compatible authenticated restart. Authenticated restart is a way to reboot FileVault 2 enabled macOS without entering the password. To perform authenticated restart one can use a dedicated terminal command: sudo fdesetup authrestart. It is also used when installing operating system updates. VirtualSMC performs authenticated restart by saving disk encryption key split in NVRAM and RTC, which despite being removed as soon as OpenCore starts, may be considered a security risk and thus is optional.
ExposeSensitiveData
Sensitive data exposure bitmask (sum) to operating system. · · · · 0x01 0x02 0x04 0x08 -- -- -- -- Expose Expose Expose Expose printable booter path as an UEFI variable. OpenCore version as an UEFI variable. OpenCore version in boot picker menu title. OEM information as a set of UEFI variables. Exposed booter path points to OpenCore.efi or its booter depending on the load order. To obtain booter path use the following command in macOS: nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:boot-path To use booter path for mounting booter volume use the following command in macOS: u=$(nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:boot-path | sed if [ "$u" != "" ]; then sudo diskutil mount $u ; fi To obtain OpenCore version use the following command in macOS: s/.*GPT,\([^,]*\),.*/\1/ ); \ nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:opencore-version To obtain OEM information use the following commands in macOS: nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:oem-product # SMBIOS Type1 ProductName nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:oem-vendor # SMBIOS Type2 Manufacturer nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:oem-board # SMBIOS Type2 ProductName
HaltLevel
EDK II debug level bitmask (sum) causing CPU to halt (stop execution) after obtaining a message of HaltLevel. Possible values match DisplayLevel values.
Vault
Enables vaulting mechanism in OpenCore. Valid values: · Optional -- require nothing, no vault is enforced, insecure. · Basic -- require vault.plist file present in OC directory. This provides basic filesystem integrity verification and may protect from unintentional filesystem corruption. · Secure -- require vault.sig signature file for vault.plist in OC directory. This includes Basic integrity checking but also attempts to build a trusted bootchain. vault.plist file should contain SHA-256 hashes for all files used by OpenCore. Presence of this file is highly recommended to ensure that unintentional file modifications (including filesystem corruption) do not happen unnoticed. To create this file automatically use create_vault.sh script. Regardless of the underlying filesystem, path name and case must match between config.plist and vault.plist. vault.sig file should contain a raw 256 byte RSA-2048 signature from SHA-256 hash of vault.plist. The signature is verified against the public key embedded into OpenCore.efi. To embed the public key you should do either of the following: · Provide public key during the OpenCore.efi compilation in OpenCoreVault.c file. · Binary patch OpenCore.efi replacing zeroes with the public key between =BEGIN OC VAULT= and ==END OC VAULT== ASCII markers. RSA public key 520 byte format description can be found in Chromium OS documentation. To convert public key from X.509 certificate or from PEM file use RsaTool. The complete set of commands to: · · · · Create vault.plist. Create a new RSA key (always do this to avoid loading old configuration). Embed RSA key into OpenCore.efi. Create vault.sig. Can look as follows: cd /Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC /path/to/create_vault.sh . /path/to/RsaTool -sign vault.plist vault.sig vault.pub off=$(($(strings -a -t d OpenCore.efi | grep "=BEGIN OC VAULT=" | cut -f1 -d dd of=OpenCore.efi if=vault.pub bs=1 seek=$off count=528 conv=notrunc rm vault.pub Note 1 : While it may appear obvious, but you have to use an external method to verify OpenCore.efi and BOOTx64.efi for secure boot path. For this you are recommended to at least enable UEFI SecureBoot with a custom certificate, and sign OpenCore.efi and BOOTx64.efi with your custom key. More details on customising secure boot on modern firmwares can be found in Taming UEFI SecureBoot paper (in Russian). Note 2 : vault.plist and vault.sig are used regardless of this option when vault.plist is present or public key is embedded into OpenCore.efi. Setting this option will only ensure configuration sanity, and abort the boot process otherwise.
ScanPolicy
Define operating system detection policy. This value allows to prevent scanning (and booting) from untrusted source based on a bitmask (sum) of select flags. As it is not possible to reliably detect every file system or device type, this feature cannot be fully relied upon in open environments, and the additional measures are to be applied. Third party drivers may introduce additional security (and performance) measures following the provided scan policy. Scan policy is exposed in scan-policy variable of 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102 GUID for UEFI Boot Services only. · 0x00000001 (bit 0) -- OC_SCAN_FILE_SYSTEM_LOCK, restricts scanning to only known file systems defined as a part of this policy. File system drivers may not be aware of this policy, and to avoid mounting of undesired file systems it is best not to load its driver. This bit does not affect dmg mounting, which may have any file system. Known file systems are prefixed with OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_. · 0x00000002 (bit 1) -- OC_SCAN_DEVICE_LOCK, restricts scanning to only known device types defined as a part of this policy. This is not always possible to detect protocol tunneling, so be aware that on some systems it may be possible for e.g. USB HDDs to be recognised as SATA. Cases like this must be reported. Known device types are prefixed with OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_. · 0x00000100 (bit 8) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_APFS, allows scanning of APFS file system. · 0x00000200 (bit 9) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_HFS, allows scanning of HFS file system. · 0x00000400 (bit 10) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_ESP, allows scanning of EFI System Partition file system. · 0x00000800 (bit 11) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_NTFS, allows scanning of NTFS (Msft Basic Data) file system. · 0x00001000 (bit 12) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_EXT, allows scanning of EXT (Linux Root) file system. · 0x00010000 (bit 16) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SATA, allow scanning SATA devices. · 0x00020000 (bit 17) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SASEX, allow scanning SAS and Mac NVMe devices. · 0x00040000 (bit 18) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SCSI, allow scanning SCSI devices. · 0x00080000 (bit 19) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_NVME, allow scanning NVMe devices. · 0x00100000 (bit 20) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_ATAPI, allow scanning CD/DVD devices. · 0x00200000 (bit 21) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_USB, allow scanning USB devices. · 0x00400000 (bit 22) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_FIREWIRE, allow scanning FireWire devices. · 0x00800000 (bit 23) -- OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SDCARD, allow scanning card reader devices. Note : Given the above description, 0xF0103 value is expected to allow scanning of SATA, SAS, SCSI, and NVMe devices with APFS file system, and prevent scanning of any devices with HFS or FAT32 file systems in addition to not scanning APFS file systems on USB, CD, and FireWire drives. The combination reads as: · · · · · · · OC_SCAN_FILE_SYSTEM_LOCK OC_SCAN_DEVICE_LOCK OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_APFS OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SATA OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SASEX OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SCSI OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_NVME
LegacyEnable
Enables loading of NVRAM variable file named nvram.plist from EFI volume root. This file must have root plist dictionary type and contain two fields: · Version -- plist integer, file version, must be set to 1. · Add -- plist dictionary, equivalent to Add from config.plist. Variable loading happens prior to Block (and Add) phases. Unless LegacyOverwrite is enabled, it will not overwrite any existing variable. Variables allowed to be set must be specified in LegacySchema. Third-party scripts may be used to create nvram.plist file. An example of such script can be found in Utilities. The use of third-party scripts may require ExposeSensitiveData set to 0x3 to provide boot-path variable with OpenCore EFI partition UUID. WARNING: This feature is very dangerous as it passes unprotected data to your firmware variable services. Use it only when no hardware NVRAM implementation is provided by the firmware or it is incompatible.
LegacyOverwrite
Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist. Note : Only variables accessible from the operating system will be overwritten.
LegacySchema
Allows setting select NVRAM variables from a map (plist dict) of GUIDs to an array (plist array) of variable names in plist string format. You can use * value to accept all variables for select GUID. WARNING: Choose variables very carefully, as nvram.plist is not vaulted. For instance, do not put boot-args or csr-active-config, as this can bypass SIP.
WriteFlash
Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables. Note : This value is recommended to be enabled on most firmwares, but is left configurable for firmwares that may have issues with NVRAM variable storage garbage collection or alike. To read NVRAM variable value from macOS one could use nvram by concatenating variable GUID and name separated by : symbol. For example, nvram 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82:boot-args. A continuously updated variable list can be found in a corresponding document: NVRAM Variables.
Automatic
Generate PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of using values from DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections. Enabling this option is useful when Generic section is flexible enough. When enabled SMBIOS, DataHub, and PlatformNVRAM data is unused.
UpdateDataHub
Update Data Hub fields. These fields are read from Generic or DataHub sections depending on Automatic value.
UpdateNVRAM
Update NVRAM fields related to platform information. These fields are read from Generic or PlatformNVRAM sections depending on Automatic value. All the other fields are to be specified with NVRAM section. If UpdateNVRAM is set to false the aforementioned variables can be updated with NVRAM section. If UpdateNVRAM is set to true the behaviour is undefined when any of the fields are present in NVRAM section.
UpdateSMBIOS
Update SMBIOS fields. These fields are read from Generic or SMBIOS sections depending on Automatic value.
UpdateSMBIOSMode
Update SMBIOS fields approach: · TryOverwrite -- Overwrite if new size is <= than the page-aligned original and there are no issues with legacy region unlock. Create otherwise. Has issues with some firmwares. · Create -- Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType at AllocateMaxAddress without any fallbacks. · Overwrite -- Overwrite existing gEfiSmbiosTableGuid and gEfiSmbiosTable3Guid data if it fits new size. Abort with unspecified state otherwise. · Custom -- Write first SMBIOS table (gEfiSmbiosTableGuid) to gOcCustomSmbiosTableGuid to workaround firmwares overwriting SMBIOS contents at ExitBootServices. Otherwise equivalent to Create. Requires patching AppleSmbios.kext and AppleACPIPlatform.kext to read from another GUID: "EB9D2D31" "EB9D2D35" (in ASCII), done automatically by CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk.
Generic
Update all fields. This section is read only when Automatic is active.
DataHub
Update Data Hub fields. This section is read only when Automatic is not active.
PlatformNVRAM
Update platform NVRAM fields. This section is read only when Automatic is not active.
SMBIOS

ConnectDrivers
Perform UEFI controller connection after driver loading. This option is useful for loading filesystem drivers, which usually follow UEFI driver model, and may not start by themselves. While effective, this option may not be necessary for drivers performing automatic connection, and may slightly slowdown the boot. Note : Some firmwares, made by Apple in particular, only connect the boot drive to speedup the boot process. Enable this option to be able to see all the boot options when having multiple drives.
Drivers
Load selected drivers from OC/Drivers directory. Designed to be filled with string filenames meant to be loaded as UEFI drivers. Depending on the firmware a different set of drivers may be required. Loading an incompatible driver may lead your system to unbootable state or even cause permanent firmware damage. Some of the known drivers include: · ApfsDriverLoader -- APFS file system bootstrap driver adding the support of embedded APFS drivers in bootable APFS containers in UEFI firmwares. · FwRuntimeServices -- OC_FIRMWARE_RUNTIME protocol implementation that increases the security of OpenCore and Lilu by supporting read-only and write-only NVRAM variables. Some quirks, like RequestBootVarRouting, require this driver for proper function. Due to the nature of being a runtime driver, i.e. functioning in parallel with the target operating system, it cannot be implemented within OpenCore itself, but is bundled with OpenCore releases. · HiiDatabase -- HII services support driver from MdeModulePkg. This driver is included in most firmwares starting with Ivy Bridge generation. Some applications with the GUI like UEFI Shell may need this driver to work properly. · EnhancedFatDxe -- FAT filesystem driver from FatPkg. This driver is embedded in all UEFI firmwares, and cannot be used from OpenCore. It is known that multiple firmwares have a bug in their FAT support implementation, which leads to corrupted filesystems on write attempt. Embedding this driver within the firmware may be required in case writing to EFI partition is needed during the boot process. · NvmExpressDxe -- NVMe support driver from MdeModulePkg. This driver is included in most firmwares starting with Broadwell generation. For Haswell and earlier embedding it within the firmware may be more favourable in case a NVMe SSD drive is installed. · AppleUsbKbDxe -- USB keyboard driver adding the support of AppleKeyMapAggregator protocols on top of a custom USB keyboard driver implementation. This is an alternative to builtin KeySupport, which may work better or worse depending on the firmware. · VBoxHfs -- HFS file system driver with bless support. This driver is an alternative to a closed source HFSPlus driver commonly found in Apple firmwares. While it is feature complete, it is approximately 3 times slower and is yet to undergo a security audit. · XhciDxe -- XHCI USB controller support driver from MdeModulePkg. This driver is included in most firmwares starting with Sandy Bridge generation. For earlier firmwares or legacy systems it may be used to support external USB 3.0 PCI cards. To compile the drivers from UDK (EDK II) use the same command you do normally use for OpenCore compilation, but choose a corresponding package: 46 git clone https://github.com/acidanthera/audk UDK cd UDK source edksetup.sh make -C BaseTools build -a X64 -b RELEASE -t XCODE5 -p FatPkg/FatPkg.dsc build -a X64 -b RELEASE -t XCODE5 -p MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc
Input
Apply individual settings designed for input (keyboard and mouse) in Input Properties section below.
Output
Apply individual settings designed for output (text and graphics) in Output Properties section below.
Protocols
Force builtin versions of select protocols described in Protocols Properties section below. Note : all protocol instances are installed prior to driver loading.
Quirks
Apply individual firmware quirks described in Quirks Properties section below.
KeyForgetThreshold
Remove key unless it was submitted during this timeout in milliseconds. AppleKeyMapAggregator protocol is supposed to contain a fixed length buffer of currently pressed keys. However, the majority of the drivers only report key presses as interrupts and pressing and holding the key on the keyboard results in subsequent submissions of this key with some defined time interval. As a result we use a timeout to remove once pressed keys from the buffer once the timeout expires and no new submission of this key happened. This option allows to set this timeout based on your platform. The recommended value that works on the majority of the platforms is 5 milliseconds. For reference, holding one key on VMware will repeat it roughly every 2 milliseconds and the same value for APTIO V is 3-4 milliseconds. Thus it is possible to set a slightly lower value on faster platforms and slightly higher value on slower platforms for more responsive input.
KeyMergeThreshold
Assume simultaneous combination for keys submitted within this timeout in milliseconds. Similarly to KeyForgetThreshold, this option works around the sequential nature of key submission. To be able to recognise simultaneously pressed keys in the situation when all keys arrive sequentially, we are required to set a timeout within which we assume the keys were pressed together. Holding multiple keys results in reports every 2 and 1 milliseconds for VMware and APTIO V respectively. Pressing keys one after the other results in delays of at least 6 and 10 milliseconds for the same platforms. The recommended value for this option is 2 milliseconds, but it may be decreased for faster platforms and increased for slower.
KeySupport
Enable internal keyboard input translation to AppleKeyMapAggregator protocol. This option activates the internal keyboard interceptor driver, based on AppleGenericInput aka (AptioInputFix), to fill AppleKeyMapAggregator database for input functioning. In case a separate driver is used, such as AppleUsbKbDxe, this option should never be enabled.
KeySupportMode
Set internal keyboard input translation to AppleKeyMapAggregator protocol mode. · · · · Auto -- Performs automatic choice as available with the following preference: AMI, V2, V1. V1 -- Uses UEFI standard legacy input protocol EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL. V2 -- Uses UEFI standard modern input protocol EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_EX_PROTOCOL. AMI -- Uses APTIO input protocol AMI_EFIKEYCODE_PROTOCOL.
KeySwap
Swap Command and Option keys during submission. This option may be useful for keyboard layouts with Option key situated to the right of Command key.
PointerSupport
Enable internal pointer driver. This option implements standard UEFI pointer protocol (EFI_SIMPLE_POINTER_PROTOCOL) through select OEM protocols. The option may be useful on Z87 ASUS boards, where EFI_SIMPLE_POINTER_PROTOCOL is broken.
PointerSupportMode
Set OEM protocol used for internal pointer driver. Currently the only supported variant is ASUS, using specialised protocol available on select Z87 and Z97 ASUS boards. More details can be found in LongSoft/UefiTool#116.
TimerResolution
Set architecture timer resolution. This option allows to update firmware architecture timer period with the specified value in 100 nanosecond units. Setting a lower value generally improves performance and responsiveness of the interface and input handling. The recommended value is 50000 (5 milliseconds) or slightly higher. Select ASUS Z87 boards use 60000 for the interface. Apple boards use 100000. You may leave it as 0 in case there are issues.
TextRenderer
Chooses renderer for text going through standard console output. Currently two renderers are supported: Builtin and System. System renderer uses firmware services for text rendering. Builtin bypassing firmware services and performs text rendering on its own. Different renderers support a different set of options. It is recommended to use Builtin renderer, as it supports HiDPI mode and uses full screen resolution. UEFI firmwares generally support ConsoleControl with two rendering modes: Graphics and Text. Some firmwares do not support ConsoleControl and rendering modes. OpenCore and macOS expect text to only be shown in Graphics mode and graphics to be drawn in any mode. Since this is not required by UEFI specification, exact behaviour varies. Valid values are combinations of text renderer and rendering mode: · · · · BuiltinGraphics -- Switch to Graphics mode and use Builtin renderer with custom ConsoleControl. SystemGraphics -- Switch to Graphics mode and use System renderer with custom ConsoleControl. SystemText -- Switch to Text mode and use System renderer with custom ConsoleControl. SystemGeneric -- Use System renderer with system ConsoleControl assuming it behaves correctly. For most platforms it is necessary to enable The use of BuiltinGraphics is generally straightforward. ProvideConsoleGop, set Resolution to Max. The use of System protocols is more complicated. In general the preferred setting is SystemGraphics or SystemText. Enabling ProvideConsoleGop, setting Resolution to Max, enabling ReplaceTabWithSpace is useful on almost all platforms. SanitiseClearScreen, IgnoreTextInGraphics, and ClearScreenOnModeSwitch are more specific, and their use depends on the firmware. Note : Some Macs, namely MacPro5,1, may have broken console output with newer GPUs, and thus only BuiltinGraphics may work for them.
ConsoleMode
Sets console output mode as specified with the WxH (e.g. 80x24) formatted string. Set to empty string not to change console mode. Set to Max to try to use largest available console mode. Currently Builtin text renderer supports only one console mode, so this option is ignored. Note : This field is best to be left empty on most firmwares.
Resolution
Sets console output screen resolution. · Set to WxH@Bpp (e.g. 1920x1080@32) or WxH (e.g. 1920x1080) formatted string to request custom resolution from GOP if available. · Set to empty string not to change screen resolution. · Set to Max to try to use largest available screen resolution. On HiDPI screens APPLE_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID UIScale NVRAM variable may need to be set to 02 to enable HiDPI scaling in Builtin text renderer, FileVault 2 UEFI password interface, and boot screen logo. Refer to Recommended Variables section for more details. Note : This will fail when console handle has no GOP protocol. When the firmware does not provide it, it can be added with ProvideConsoleGop set to true.
ClearScreenOnModeSwitch
Some firmwares clear only part of screen when switching from graphics to text mode, leaving a fragment of previously drawn image visible. This option fills the entire graphics screen with black color before switching to text mode. Note : This option only applies to System renderer.
DirectGopRendering
Use builtin graphics output protocol renderer for console. On some firmwares this may provide better performance or even fix rendering issues, like on MacPro5,1. However, it is recommended not to use this option unless there is an obvious benefit as it may even result in slower scrolling.
IgnoreTextInGraphics
Select firmwares output text onscreen in both graphics and text mode. This is normally unexpected, because random text may appear over graphical images and cause UI corruption. Setting this option to true will discard all text output when console control is in mode different from Text. Note : This option only applies to System renderer.
ReplaceTabWithSpace
Some firmwares do not print tab characters or even everything that follows them, causing difficulties or inability to use the UEFI Shell builtin text editor to edit property lists and other documents. This option makes the console output spaces instead of tabs. Note : This option only applies to System renderer.
ProvideConsoleGop
Ensure GOP (Graphics Output Protocol) on console handle. macOS bootloader requires GOP to be present on console handle, yet the exact location of GOP is not covered by the UEFI specification. This option will ensure GOP is installed on console handle if it is present. Note : This option will also replace broken GOP protocol on console handle, which may be the case on MacPro5,1 with newer GPUs.
ReconnectOnResChange
Reconnect console controllers after changing screen resolution. On some firmwares when screen resolution is changed via GOP, it is required to reconnect the controllers, which produce the console protocols (simple text out). Otherwise they will not produce text based on the new resolution. Note : On several boards this logic may result in black screen when launching OpenCore from Shell and thus it is optional. In versions prior to 0.5.2 this option was mandatory and not configurable. Please do not use this unless required.
SanitiseClearScreen
Some firmwares reset screen resolution to a failsafe value (like 1024x768) on the attempts to clear screen contents when large display (e.g. 2K or 4K) is used. This option attempts to apply a workaround. Note : This option only applies to System renderer. On all known affected systems ConsoleMode had to be set to empty string for this to work.
AppleBootPolicy
Reinstalls Apple Boot Policy protocol with a builtin version. This may be used to ensure APFS compatibility on VMs or legacy Macs. Note : Some Macs, namely MacPro5,1, do have APFS compatibility, but their Apple Boot Policy protocol contains recovery detection issues, thus using this option is advised on them as well.
AppleEvent
Reinstalls Apple Event protocol with a builtin version. This may be used to ensure File Vault 2 compatibility on VMs or legacy Macs.
AppleImageConversion
Reinstalls Apple Image Conversion protocol with a builtin version.
AppleKeyMap
Reinstalls Apple Key Map protocols with builtin versions.
AppleSmcIo
Reinstalls Apple SMC I/O protocol with a builtin version. This protocol replaces legacy VirtualSmc UEFI driver, and is compatible with any SMC kernel extension. However, in case FakeSMC kernel extension is used, manual NVRAM key variable addition may be needed.
AppleUserInterfaceTheme
Reinstalls Apple User Interface Theme protocol with a builtin version.
DataHub
Reinstalls Data Hub protocol with a builtin version. This will drop all previous properties if the protocol was already installed.
DeviceProperties
Reinstalls Device Property protocol with a builtin version. This will drop all previous properties if it was already installed. This may be used to ensure full compatibility on VMs or legacy Macs.
FirmwareVolume
Forcibly wraps Firmware Volume protocols or installs new to support custom cursor images for File Vault 2. Should be set to true to ensure File Vault 2 compatibility on everything but VMs and legacy Macs. Note : Several virtual machines including VMware may have corrupted cursor image in HiDPI mode and thus may also require this setting to be enabled.
HashServices
Forcibly reinstalls Hash Services protocols with builtin versions. Should be set to true to ensure File Vault 2 compatibility on platforms providing broken SHA-1 hashing. Can be diagnosed by invalid cursor size with UIScale set to 02, in general platforms prior to APTIO V (Haswell and older) are affected.
OSInfo
Forcibly reinstalls OS Info protocol with builtin versions. This protocol is generally used to receive notifications from macOS bootloader, by the firmware or by other applications.
UnicodeCollation
Forcibly reinstalls unicode collation services with builtin version. Should be set to true to ensure UEFI Shell compatibility on platforms providing broken unicode collation. In general legacy Insyde and APTIO platforms on Ivy Bridge and earlier are affected.
ExitBootServicesDelay
Adds delay in microseconds after EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES event. This is a very ugly quirk to circumvent "Still waiting for root device" message on select APTIO IV firmwares, namely ASUS Z87-Pro, when using FileVault 2 in particular. It seems that for some reason they execute code in parallel to EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES, which results in SATA controller being inaccessible from macOS. A better approach should be found in some future. Expect 3-5 seconds to be enough in case the quirk is needed.
IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio
Select firmwares, namely APTIO IV, may contain invalid values in MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) MSR register. These values may cause macOS boot failure on Intel platforms. Note : While the option is not supposed to induce harm on unaffected firmwares, its usage is not recommended when it is not required.
ReleaseUsbOwnership
Attempt to detach USB controller ownership from the firmware driver. While most firmwares manage to properly do that, or at least have an option for, select firmwares do not. As a result, operating system may freeze upon boot. Not recommended unless required.
RequestBootVarFallback
Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID to EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID. This quirk requires RequestBootVarRouting to be enabled and therefore OC_FIRMWARE_RUNTIME protocol implemented in FwRuntimeServices.efi. By redirecting Boot prefixed variables to a separate GUID namespace we achieve multiple goals: · Operating systems are jailed and only controlled by OpenCore boot environment to enhance security. · Operating systems do not mess with OpenCore boot priority, and guarantee fluent updates and hibernation wakes for cases that require reboots with OpenCore in the middle. · Potentially incompatible boot entries, such as macOS entries, are not deleted or anyhow corrupted. However, some firmwares do their own boot option scanning upon startup by checking file presence on the available disks. Quite often this scanning includes non-standard locations, such as Windows Bootloader paths. Normally it is not an issue, but some firmwares, ASUS firmwares on APTIO V in particular, have bugs. For them scanning is implemented improperly, and firmware preferences may get accidentally corrupted due to BootOrder entry duplication (each option will be added twice) making it impossible to boot without cleaning NVRAM. To trigger the bug one should have some valid boot options (e.g. OpenCore) and then install Windows with RequestBootVarRouting enabled. As Windows bootloader option will not be created by Windows installer, the firmware will attempt to create it itself, and then corrupt its boot option list. This quirk forwards all UEFI specification valid boot options, that are not related to macOS, to the firmware into BootF### and BootOrder variables upon write. As the entries are added to the end of BootOrder, this does not break boot priority, but ensures that the firmware does not try to append a new option on its own after Windows installation for instance.
RequestBootVarRouting
Request redirect of all Boot prefixed variables from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. This quirk requires OC_FIRMWARE_RUNTIME protocol implemented in FwRuntimeServices.efi. The quirk lets default boot entry preservation at times when firmwares delete incompatible boot entries. Simply said, you are required to enable this quirk to be able to reliably use Startup Disk preference pane in a firmware that is not compatible with macOS boot entries by design.
UnblockFsConnect
Some firmwares block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Note : The quirk is mostly relevant for select HP laptops with no drives listed.
Scale
Sets text renderer HiDPI scaling in percents. Currently only 100 and 200 values are supported. Note : This option only applies to Builtin renderer.
